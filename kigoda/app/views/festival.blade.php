        <h3 style="text-align: center">6TH MWALIMU NYERERE INTELLECTUAL FESTIVAL – 9TH- 11TH APRIL 2014</h3>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">THEME: LIBERATING THE MIND FOR AFRICA’S ADVANCEMENT</h3>

        <p>Under this theme, an interrogation will be done of the role of the mind-set in spurring or deterring Africa’s
            economic, social and cultural advancement. The guiding thesis is that whereas huge efforts and investments
            are directed at numerous development strategies and programmes, little attention is paid to understanding the
            role played by a people’s mind-set which is critical in achieving or not achieving development goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 6th Mwalimu Nyerere Intellectual festival will therefore, be dedicated to a critical analysis of how the
            mind-set is impacting, positively or negatively, on the economic, social and cultural advancement
            of the African continent. Past and contemporary Pan-African attempts to address this factor of
            development will also be explored.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center">SUB- THEMES</h3>
